<h1>Run For Cover</h1>
<h3>A Full Stack Project/Work In Progress by Melissa Luna</h3>

<h2>A Song Tracking App</h2>

<a href="https://mrlmic.github.io/rfcFront/">See it Live</a>
<p>This app allows you to keep track of songs that you like and whether they were originally performed by the artist.</p>

<p>The app works by adding songs to SQL databases. The songs are displayed using Handlebars. The app checks to see if the logged in user's id matches the user id reference column before allowing changes to any songs.</p>

<p>In the future, I would like to enable the user to push their songs to a game database. The game would prompt the user with a song title and artist and ask them if the song was originally performed by this person.</p>

<h2>Planning, User Stories & Wireframes</h2>
<p>To plan for this project, I first read over the project requirements and created a Trello board for myself. On this board, as I completed tasks I would move them to a "Done" column. I also created a "Wish List" column which included things like CSS tweaks I wanted to make, but were not required.</p>

<h3>User Stories</h3>
<ol><li>I'm a user who is concerned about security and would like to log in to any website I use.</li>
<li>I'm a user who wants to be entertained by the appearance of a site.</li>
<li>I'm a user who is not very experienced with the internet and needs a site to be easy to operate.</li></ol>
